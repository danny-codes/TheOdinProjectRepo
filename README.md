## Build Tools & APIs

These projects are built using modern JavaScript tooling including **Webpack** and **npm**.  
The Weather App practices working with asynchronous JavaScript and APIs by:

- Handling asynchronous code with `async/await`  
- Fetching weather data from a public API and updating the UI dynamically

---

## Project Descriptions

### Weather App

A simple weather dashboard that fetches live weather data from a public API.  
Built with modern JavaScript using Webpack and npm for bundling.

### Todo List

A fully functional todo list application with:

- Creation, editing, and deletion of tasks and projects  
- Task prioritization and completion toggles  
- Persistent storage using the Web Storage API (`localStorage`)

The app emphasizes clean modular code, separation of concerns, and responsive design.

---

## Additional Learnings

- Working with asynchronous JavaScript and APIs  
- Managing application state and persistence with `localStorage`  
- Modular JavaScript architecture  
- Responsive UI design with CSS Flexbox and Grid  
- Using npm libraries such as `date-fns` for date manipulation  
- Webpack for bundling and asset optimization
