# The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript ‚Äî Live Projects

Welcome to the live versions of my projects from **The Odin Project**!  
This branch hosts the projects I built as part of the [The Odin Project Full Stack JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-javascript).

## üìö üõ† Skills & Tools Learned 

Throughout these projects, I developed practical skills and worked with modern JavaScript tools, including:

- **JavaScript fundamentals:** DOM Manipulation, Event Handling, Data Structures & Algorithms, Form Validation  
- **Asynchronous JavaScript & APIs:** Handling async code with `async/await`, fetching and processing data from public APIs (e.g., Weather App)  
- **Application state management:** Using `localStorage` for data persistence in the Todo List project  
- **Modular architecture:** Writing clean, maintainable code with ES6 modules, factory functions, and classes  
- **Responsive UI Design:** Building layouts with CSS Flexbox and Grid for mobile-friendly interfaces  
- **Tooling:** Using Webpack and npm for bundling, package management, and asset optimization  
- **Libraries:** Utilizing helpful npm packages such as `date-fns` for date manipulation and formatting  

These combined skills showcase a full-stack JavaScript foundation and modern web development best practices.
